Normalization\n","We already saw that batch normalization is a very useful technique for training deep fully-connected networks. As proposed in the original paper (link in `BatchNormalization.ipynb`), batch normalization can also be used for convolutional networks, but we need to tweak it a bit; the modification will be called \"spatial batch normalization.\"\n","\n","Normally batch-normalization accepts inputs of shape `(N, D)` and produces outputs of shape `(N, D)`, where we normalize across the minibatch dimension `N`. For data coming from convolutional layers, batch normalization needs to accept inputs of shape `(N, C, H, W)` and produce outputs of shape `(N, C, H, W)` where the `N` dimension gives the minibatch size and the `(H, W)` dimensions give the spatial size of the feature map.\n","\n","If the feature map was produced using convolutions, then we expect every feature channel's statistics e.g. mean, variance to be relatively consistent both between different images, and different locations within the same image -- after all, every feature channel is produced by the same convolutional filter! Therefore spatial batch normalization computes a mean and variance for each of the `C` feature channels by computing statistics over the minibatch dimension `N` as well the spatial dimensions `H` and `W`.\n","\n","\n","[1] [Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy, \"Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing\n","Internal Covariate Shift\", ICML 2015.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bUAK2MxThqVg"},"source":["## Spatial batch normalization: forward\n","\n","In the file `cs231n/layers.py`, implement the forward pass for spatial batch normalization in the function `spatial_batchnorm_forward`.
